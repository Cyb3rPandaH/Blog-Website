In this quick blogpost, I will share the steps that you can follow in order to install Visual Studio Code *(VSCode)* on a Windows computer.

## 1. Downloading VSCode Executable

- Go to [Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Click on **Download for Windows**

## 2. Running VSCode Executable

- At the bottom of the page, click on **Run**.
- If you are using a different browser rather than *Microsoft Edge*, you might get a different word such as **Open**.
